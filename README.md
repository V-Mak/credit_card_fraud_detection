# credit_card_fraud_detection

The credit card fraud detection dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning practitioners and researchers interested in developing fraud detection algorithms. The dataset contains over 284,000 transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent ones. It is a challenging dataset to work with due to the imbalance between the two classes, but it is a valuable resource for learning about fraud detection techniques.

The dataset was collected and analyzed during a research collaboration between Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (MLG) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) on big data mining and fraud detection. The dataset contains transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the Kaggle website.

There are several different versions of the credit card fraud detection dataset available on Kaggle. The most popular version is the one from the Machine Learning Group (MLG) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). This dataset was collected and analyzed during a research collaboration between Worldline and the MLG on big data mining and fraud detection.

The given features are:
time: The timestamp of the transaction.
V1 to V28: 28 numerical features that represent transaction details, such as the amount of the transaction, the location of the transaction, and the type of card used.
amount: The transaction amount.
The class label for each transaction is a binary variable indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
